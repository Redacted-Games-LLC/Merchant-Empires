<div class="header2 header_bold">Base Package Deployment</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	You can pick up a base package at any tech dealer. Bases can be deployed on just about
	any planetoid which can support a port.
</div>
<div class="header3 header_bold">Base Area</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	When deployed a base package will terraform a flat land area of 100x100. The depth of 
	the prepared soil will not be enough to maintain shrubbery or trees, but grasses may
	grow. Some minor debris such as rocks will be present but will not affect construction.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Depending on the planet resources can be mined out such as oil, gems or catalysts. Other
	surface resources might be possible such as planting trees, but even if not alternatives
	such as domed tree farms might be an option.
</div>
<div class="header3 header_bold">Control Pad</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Bases will automatically start construction of a Control Pad. When finished, you will be
	able to land on a base.
