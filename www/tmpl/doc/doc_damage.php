<div class="header2 header_bold">Damage Types</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	There are three types of damage types which can be delivered to ships
	or forces: general damage, shield damage, and armor damage. When a
	ship runs out of armor it is destroyed and the player inside is
	ejected in an escape pod.
</div>
<div class="header3 header_bold">General Damage</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	General damage will reduce shields first, then armor. This type of damage
	will come mostly from <a href="docs.php?page=ordnance">sector ordnance</a>
	such as mines and drones. 
</div>
<div class="header3 header_bold">Shield and Armor Damage</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Like the names imply, these damage types directly affect the shield and
	armor ratings on a ship. Armor cannot be damaged until shields have been
	depleted.
