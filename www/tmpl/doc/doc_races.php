<div class="docs_text">
	All planets in the galaxy have long been made habitable and
	are populated by Imperially governed members of one of three
	races:
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	<ul>
		<li><a href="docs.php?page=xollian">The Secretive Xollian</a></li>
		<li><a href="docs.php?page=mawlor">The Mawlor Dominion</a></li>
		<li><a href="docs.php?page=zycklirg">The Infested Zyck'lirg</a></li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Members of opposing races are <strong>at war</strong> with
	other races. There are <a href="docs.php?page=alignment">alignment</a>
	changes if you kill allied or enemy player.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	With the exception of Xollians players pay taxes on their own racial 
	ports when trading. If trading in an enemy port they also pay the
	enemy tax rate, including Xollians.
</div>
<div class="header3">Lore</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	The people of these races have been at war with each other
	for a thousand years or more. The cause is long forgotten,
	only a few treaties remain untouched; neighbor to
	crippling combat the Imperial Government somehow manages
	to persist.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Planetary non-combatants are protected but forbidden to 
	participate in the ongoing war. However, it is common for
	foreign owned trading ports outside of Imperial Protected
	Space to price gouge their enemy traders with a smile on
	their face.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	There were other races which inhabited the galaxy cluster
	which have long been destroyed. What little is known has 
	been convoluted by propaganda. It is believed amongst some
	conspiracy circles that remaining members of these races
	are in control of the Imperial Government but not one
	of them have been identified in public in centuries.
