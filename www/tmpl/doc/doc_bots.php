<div class="header2">Bot Policy</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Reasonable and well-made bots are allowed for trade only, not combat. The following
	sections go into detail.
</div>
<div class="header3">Keep-Alives</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	You may use a keep-alive or page refresher if it only reloads the page once every
	ten seconds.
</div>
<div class="header3">Automation Bots</div>
<div class="docs_text">
 	Bots which automate trade routes cannot make a call to the file handler.php more often
 	than once every four seconds. Every move, every action, 4 seconds. Botted traders should
 	obvious to an observer.
</div>
<div class="header3">Combat Bots</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Please don't. There will be those of you that do, some of you will be really good at it
	and get away with it. Some who are caught will announce they were going to quit anyway,
	others will seem to be sociopathically indifferent to the whole thing. Some will publicly
	apologize and even though they will dance around not caring if they are forgiven, they
	will really care; it is trust they are trying to salvage.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Using a combat bot is on par with griefing. <a href="docs.php?page=hosting">Download and host</a>
	your own version of the game and run it as an anarchy server if you want to combat bot.
</div>
<div class="header3">Forensics</Bots>
<div class="docs_text">
	We are able to track and document the long term behavior of players, if you suspect a player is
	using a bot in a manner inconsistent with the policies report it. This takes quite a bit of time
	so please do not be upset if it seems like we aren't doing anything. Trust me, we are.
