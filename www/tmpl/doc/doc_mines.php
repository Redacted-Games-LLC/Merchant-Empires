	Mines
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Mines are used to make sector passage dangerous to non-allied players. Unlike previous ME
	versions mines <strong>do not trap</strong>; they simply explode.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	A player can safely enter a mined sector but may trigger some of them to explode when 
	attempting to leave. There is no other way to back out so it is advisable for a player to
	use a <a href="docs.php?page=scanner">scanner</a> where possible to avoid entering sectors
	with hostile forces.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	There can be up to <?php echo MAX_ORDNANCE_PER_SECTOR; ?> mines in a sector. Each player
	can have a stack of up to <?php echo MAX_ORDNANCE_PER_PLAYER; ?> mines, and there is an
	<?php echo MINE_HIT_PERCENT; ?>% Percent chance a player will hit one of those stacks. If
	a stack is hit, up to <?php echo MINES_ATTACKING_PER_PLAYER * 100; ?>% of the stack can
	hit the player. Finally, each mine does <?php echo MINE_ATTACK_DAMAGE; ?> points of 
	<a href="docs.php?page=damage">general damage</a>.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Once mines are deployed they cannot be picked up. However, they are unstable enough on
	their own to be destroyed easily by any sort of weapon blast. Since targetting is 100%
	efficient you can destroy as many in one shot as weapons installed on your ship.
