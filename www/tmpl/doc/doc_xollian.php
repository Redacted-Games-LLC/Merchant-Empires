<div class="header2 header_bold">The Secretive Xollian</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	The Xollians might possibly have the most interesting history if anything were
	known about it. They are a secretive people with a culture of privacy.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Xollians pay a lower trade tax than Mawlors and Zyck'lirgs, but it
	is unclear which treaty permits this. They also remain the only
	race in the galaxy capable of producing Cloak technology. Other races
	have attempted to reverse-engineer Cloak from stolen ships but are 
	never successful.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Xollians can learn to operate Mawlor ships, but lacking the war-like
	culture (and the arm-length to reach all the controls quickly), they
	face a 10% decline in weapon accuracy.
</div>
<div class="header3 header_bold">Cloak Technology</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Xollian ships are equipped with Cloak technology. They are effectively invisible
	to all players of lower level (rank is not considered). Cloak is disabled when a
	player fires their weapons and costs <?php echo CLOAK_TURN_COST; ?> turns to re-enable it.
</div>
<div class="header3 header_bold">Balance Notes</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Xollians are the best traders of the galaxy. They should be avoiding combat,
	instead taking advantage of the economy to best their enemies. A Xollian might
	not win a fight but he'll most easily afford a replacement ship.
