<div class="docs_text">
	The Xollians might possibly have the most interesting history if 
	anything was known about it. They are a secretive people with a culture
	of privacy.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Xollians pay a lower trade tax than Mawlors and Zyck'lirgs, but it
	is unclear which treaty permits this. They also remain the only
	race in the galaxy capable of utilizing cloak technology.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Xollians can learn to operate Mawlor ships but lacking the war-like
	culture (and the arm-length to reach all the controls quickly) they
	face a 10% decline in weapon accuracy.
</div>
<div class="header3">Cloak Technology</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Xollian ships are equipped with Cloak technology. They are effectively invisible
	to all players of lower level (rank is not considered). Cloak is disabled when a
	player fires their weapons and costs <?php echo CLOAK_TURN_COST; ?> turns to re-enable it.
</div>
<div class="header3">Balance Notes</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Xollians are the best traders of the galaxy. They should be avoiding combat,
	instead taking advantage of the economy to best their enemies. A Xollian might
	not win a fight but he'll most easily afford a replacement ship.
