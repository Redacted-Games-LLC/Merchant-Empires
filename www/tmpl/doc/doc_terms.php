	By joining this server as a user and/or player you agree to the following
	terms and conditions of use.
</div>
<div class="header3">Basic Stuff</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	We make no warranties for this product; it is provided as-is. If you don't
	like what we have going on you can <a href="docs.php?page=hosting">download
	and host</a> your own version of the game.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	This is a game. All games come with a bit of personal commitment, but the idea
	is to have fun. If it stops being fun you only embitter yourself by sticking
	around. Don't forget to take breaks; get up and pace around a bit every so often
	at minimum.
</div>
<div class="header3">Compensation for Bugs</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	The long and short is we won't give you back your goods, credits, experience,
	alignment, or turns that you lost for whatever reason. I am sorry for the 
	situation but please report the bug and we can try to fix it or tell us about
	the unfair event and we can examine if there is a balance issue.
</div>
<div class="header3">Gold Membership Issues</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Players can activate <a href="docs.php?page=gold">Gold Memberships</a> with
	keys earned by themselves or given by other users. Users who donate and earn keys
	are given support for their transaction but <em>not</em> for key usage beyond
	activation.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	When the round officially ends a special key will be generated with any remaining gold
	membership time.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	If you have issues with your keys please contact the administration.
