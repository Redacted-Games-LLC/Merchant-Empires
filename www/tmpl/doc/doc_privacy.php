<div class="header2">Privacy Practices</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	We don't intentionally share your information. We try to prevent accidentally sharing your
	data. If compelled by US law we will of course comply.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	If we show ads we will only share our own info such as affiliate identifiers but the ad may have
	access to some request info like your ip address. We might not be able to prevent this depending
	on the ad company we affiliate with.
</div>
<div class="header3">Personal Information</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	We don't share anything we collect, but whether or not anything we do collect is personally
	identifiable is really up to you. We won't ask you for your real name or address or such.
	The following is a list of things we ask for.
</div>
<div class="header4">Username</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Our signup page requires a username for login purposes. The username you choose is stored
	in our database for login purposes only. This information is not publicly shared. You should
	never use personally identifiable information in a username.
</div>
<div class="header4">Passwords</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Passwords are stored using a hash function and every user has their own generated salt. Upon
	logging in your password attempt is hashed in the same way and compared to what we have
	stored in our db. Though we cannot recover an original cleartext password you should not use
	personal information when choosing one.
</div>
<div class="header4">Email Address</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Our signup page asks an email address but you do not have to give one. Email addresses may be
	personally identifiable by nature; we only use it for password recovery and if we have to
	notify you about an issue with your account, not with your players. We will not send you news,
	updates, or other spam emails. Your email address will not be shared, sold, or made available
	publicly by us.
</div>
<div class="header4">Player Names</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Players can name their characters. Player names are public and players may also elect to share
	their player name online. Choosing names may unintentionally create a forensic connection to
	other online identities they may have. Players must assume their own risk when creating a
	player name, including whether to use names which are known in other game universes or even a
	real name.
