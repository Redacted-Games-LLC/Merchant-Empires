<div class="header2">The Mawlor Dominion</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	If you've been in a fight with a Mawlor, you definitely understand
	how these guys earn their reputation. They can take lots of hits 
	and withstand a very long battle. They somehow also retained the monopoly
	over jump drive units, and tend to disappear quick in battle.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	A lone Mawlor is vulnerable; their low-speed weapons leave time
	for enemy reinforcements to arrive and overwhelm them. Mawlors tend
	to use more escape pods than others, usually because they tried
	to hunt by themselves.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Mawlors can learn to operate Xollian ships, but consider it dishonorable when they
	do so. They will gain no experience nor alignment (but could still lose alignment)
	while operating a Xollian ship.
</div>
<div class="header3">Jump Technology</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Mawlor ships are equipped with Jump Technology. Loosely based on Paragon Warps,
	a Mawlor "sets" his Jump at any star in the galaxy. Activating jump returns the
	Mawlor ship to that star. It is a one-way journey costing <?php echo JUMP_TURN_COST; ?>
	turns.
</div>
<div class="header3">Balance Notes</div>
<div class="docs_text">
    Mawlors are balanced to be the late round war boss. This race is best for
    players who like to build up a powerful character slowly, but with great reward.
    Early Mawlors will grumble about their weaker-levelled ships.
