	By far the most player time will be spent flying around on bases. A
	base allows players to produce goods which are not available via 
	upgrade paths but are nevertheless in demand. One notable example is
	oil.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	Bases also provide a measure of protection depending on how advanced
	they are and the attention to defense.
</div>
<div class="header3 header_bold">Getting a Base</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	A <a href="docs.php?page=base_package">Base Package</a> allows you to deploy a 
	base. Then, just find a planetoid in an unprotected sector. Use the ship screen
	and enter a name for the base. The default name is: <?php echo DEFAULT_BASE_CAPTION; ?>
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	When you deploy a base a Control Pad will be started automatically for you near
	the center. A Control Pad is a special version of the Landing Pad which cannot be
	removed and allows access to base control functions. Since the only way to land on
	a base is through a Landing Pad you won't be able to land until this Control Pad
	is finished.
</div>
<div class="header3 header_bold">Landing on a Base</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	You can land on a base only on Landing Pads. All bases will have a Control Pad
	near the center. Bases are 100x100 putting the center at 50,50 <strong>but</strong>
	when hovering you are flying over twice the area; the hover center is 25,25.
