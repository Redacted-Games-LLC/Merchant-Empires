	To host your own Merchant Empires server you should be able to set up and secure a 
	MySQL database server and an Apache web server running PHP. If doing these things
	are out of your reach you may want to seek assistance. We may be able to set you
	up at a low cost.
</div>
<div class="docs_text">
	You can get ahold of the source at our
	<a href="https://github.com/Redacted-Games-LLC/Merchant-Empires" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository</a>.
	The game does not come with any goods or ships, those must be added by you before
	the game is playable. There is a starter pack which contains some early goods and
	upgrades available.

<div class="docs_text">
	More information will follow as we streamline this process.
